# Intro

After Part I, the plan was formed, but there is an issue - stopping a wave on the graphics ring will hang the GPU. This in turn will also hang the desktop on Linux currently, so it is not feasible to have the debugger running
on the same computer (unless perhaps a second GPU is used or the debugged shader is a compute shader running on a compute ring). This might seem like a wrench in the works, but fortunately, I have recently acquired the thing
that I think is currently the ultimate development kit: the Steam Deck.

Why is the Deck such a nice option?

- Recent AMD GPU (vangogh / gfx10.3 / RDNA2)
- Comes preinstalled with Linux, easily remotable
- Blazing fast reboot
- Compact enough that it fits below your monitor!

After just a bit of setup, we can get a good development experience going, despite the amount of trouble that hanging the GPU usually causes.

   ... because I have hung the GPU while working on this project at least 50 times.

_This post is really dry, so I added some memes._
   
In this post I want to share my tips on turning the Deck into the **Devk**, which is hopefully useful to some, but ultimately skippable if you are only interested in the GPU bits.

# Remote setup

For remote development, we can use `ssh`. For me just using a terminal is a bit too puritanical, so I would recommend setting up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) for this purpose (or a similar remote dev environment). It is also recommend to set up ssh keys to avoid having to do password authentication each time.

You will also need to set up your Deck for development:
1. create a password for the `deck` user (`passwd`)
1. disable the read-only filesystem (`sudo steamos-readonly disable`)
1. initialise `pacman` keyring (`sudo pacman-key --init`)
1. populate the pacman keyring with the default Arch Linux keys (`sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux`)
1. *optional, but recommended step* change the boot DE to be `plasma` (desktop mode), instead of `gamescope`:

```diff
[Autologin]
-Session=gamescope-wayland.desktop
+Session=plasma.desktop
```
{: file="/etc/sddm.conf.d/zz-steamos-autologin.conf" }

Note that upgrading your OS will undo some of these steps, including removing packages.

# Mesa development environment

For getting up to speed with mesa building, follow the instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/Venemo/a9483106565df3a83fc67a411191edbd) - thanks to [@pixelcluster](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@pixelcluster) for setting me up with the instructions for this bit!
Unfortunately it seems like the Deck ships with some development packages installed, but with the headers not in place - I recommend reinstalling all the packages that are already installed.

Remember to set up `mesa-run.sh` from the instructions and then you can just do `mesa-run.sh target_pgm`.
I also set up a handy `mesa-run-gdb.sh`, which just passes the arguments to `gdb` instead:

```bash
MESA=$HOME/mesa_dbg \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MESA/lib64:$MESA/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=$MESA/lib64/dri:$MESA/lib/dri \
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$MESA/share/vulkan/icd.d/radeon_icd.x86_64.json \
D3D_MODULE_PATH=$MESA/lib64/d3d/d3dadapter9.so.1:$MESA/lib/d3d/d3dadapter9.so.1 \
gdb "$@"
```
{: file="mesa-run-gdb.sh" }

{% comment %}
I also set up handy build scripts - just to not forget what is needed. Here is my `~/mesa/build.sh`:

```bash
pushd ~/mesa
meson build64radvdebug --libdir lib64 --prefix $HOME/mesa_dbg -Ddri-drivers= -Dgallium-drivers= -Dvulkan-drivers=amd -Dosmesa=false -Dbuildtype=debug
ninja -C build64radvdebug install
popd
```
{: file="~/mesa/build.sh" }

## Increasing the amdgpu lockup_timeout

When we submit some work to the GPU and the KMD waits for it, there is a timeout after which the GPU is considered hung. When this happens the KMD will attempt to reset the device. During my experimentation, the KMD usually does not succeed at this, so once the timeout is hit, it is better to reboot.

But if we want to controllably hang the GPU, we need to raise this timeout to avoid the device being reset below our feet - to do this we need to add a new timeout value to kernel cmdline.
The key-value pair of `amdgpu.lockup_timeout=<timeout>` needs to be added to `/boot/efi/EFI/steamos/grub.cfg` - you can do this by editing `/etc/default/grub` and running `grub-mkconfig`. The default timeout for graphics is 10000, which is in milliseconds.

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles tsc=directsync module_blacklist=tpm log_buf_len=4M amd_iommu=off amdgpu.gttsize=8128 spi_amd.speed_dev=1 audit=0 fbcon=vc:4-6 fbcon=rotate:1 amdgpu.lockup_timeout=100000"
```
{: file="/etc/default/grub" }

# Screen

A problem we face now is that we want to run programs on Deck locally, but we don't want to actually touch the Deck itself. An easy way of accomplishing this is using the utility `screen`, which allows running a local terminal session, that can be interacted with remotely.
Create a script on desktop with:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
xterm -hold -e "screen -xR ff"
```
{: file="screen.sh" }

And then tapping on this shortcut will open a terminal with a `screen` session running named `ff`. You can also make this start automatically of course - or just shut the Deck down cleanly once for it to start it back up automatically.

Once you have the `screen` session ongoing, you can just write to that session by using the `screen` commmand `stuff`. For example for running our target app:

```bash
screen -r ff -x -X stuff "mesa-run.sh ./target_app\n"
```
{: file="run.sh" }

Note the `\n` - this is because we really are just remotely typing into the local shell.
And then we can use the same idea to kill the app by "pressing" Ctrl-C:

```bash
screen -r ff -x -X stuff "^C"
```
{: file="kill.sh" }

# Compiling AMD ISA

To compile AMD ISA, we set up a small script that will use `clang+llvm` to compile, then pull out the `.text` section of the ELF file into a binary file called `asmc.hex`.

```bash
clang -c -x assembler -target amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx1030 -o asm.o $1
objdump -h asm.o | grep .text | awk '{print "dd if='asm.o' of='asmc.hex' bs=1 count=$[0x" $3 "] skip=$[0x" $6 "] status=none"}' | bash
rm asm.o
```
{: file="ll-as.sh" }

![Unimportant meme about writing ISA](/assets/radbg/isa.png){: w="300" h="400" }
_The only caveat to this section._

To check if everything went well, it is possible to dump the resulting binary file and disassemble it using `llvm-mc`:

```bash
hexdump -v -e '/1 "0x%02X "' $1 | llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=gfx1030 -disassemble
```
{: file="ll-dis.sh" }

# Conclusion

With Devk set up, in the next post we get into the nitty-gritty and figure out how to make trap handlers work!
