# Intro
GPUs are complex beasts - and certainly more mysterious in some ways than CPUs which come with ample amounts of documentation and manuals. Aspiring graphics programmers are sometimes left
to scrounge old GDC presentations on performance tips and very little is known about the inner workings of some GPUs - too small to have a devrel contact to give insight.

The Linux graphics stack is a beacon of light in this murky world, providing a wealth of insight into the inner workings. AMD also has an excellent [initiative](https://gpuopen.com/) of publishing documents about hardware,
including ISA manuals (unfortunately 3D registers documents are no longer published for new architectures).

When graphics shader debugging was brought up on the [Graphics Programming Discord server](https://discord.gg/6mgNGk7) recently, I got curious - I have previously seen references to shader debugging in the AMD ISA manuals. It turns out 
[@ishitatsuyuki](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ishitatsuyuki@mstdn.maud.io) has done some sleuthing on how things are done on the GPU compute side - including finding [compute wave save/restore](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/cwsr_trap_handler_gfx10.asm) and the related host-side management, but the conclusion was that 
graphics waves are most likely too complex to save and restore (how to recover rasterization and output state?). However upon some discussion with Ishi it seemed like the wave management commands were still applicable.
Furthermore, [umr](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/tomstdenis/umr), AMD's user-mode debugging facility for Linux also hinted towards the possibility of manipulating waves for graphics. 

And so I began digging deeper, learning things as I went - which I will try to share here. By the end of this blog series, I will show a proof-of-concept implementation of all the relevant bits for a true hardware-based debugger
on AMD GPUs on Linux - letting us manipulate the state of the GPU directly from the host to debug the state of graphics and compute shaders.

But first, a brief overview on the current state of GPU tooling to see what is available when GPU programs go wrong.

## Current state of GPU tooling on PC

The GPU scene is divided into Graphics and Compute. For Compute, one can get the amenities known on the CPU - CUDA and ROCm have proper debuggers, supporting breakpoints, watchpoints, single stepping and so on.

For Graphics, the tools are instead trace based. [NSight](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics) (NVidia's offering), [RGP](https://gpuopen.com/rgp/) (AMD's offering) and 
[RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) all work on the basis of trace replaying.
What this means is that when you make a capture with RenderDoc, your API calls are intercepted and recorded.

You can then review the state of your application during the capture via RenderDoc replaying the commands of the application for you. RenderDoc also offers shader debugging - 
this is achieved by a form of CPU/GPU hybrid emulation of the shader code - since shader behaviour has a lot of implementation dependence, for faithful replay Renderdoc compiles
small snippets of shader code, that are ran when the program is stepped, while the shader state is maintained in memory. 
The disadvantage of such emulation is that due to computational requirements, emulating larger bodies of work is not currently done, essentially providing a single threaded view of the execution 
(no cross-invocation or cross-subgroup communication).

Another difficulty is diagnosing device loss issues. With Vulkan allowing the use of GPU virtual memory addresses and arbitrary computation on them (buffer device address), memory violations became commonplace.
While accesses through descriptors can be made robust (out of bounds reads return 0, writes are discarded), no such facility is available for direct virtual memory access. Device lost diagnosis is still quite limited - although there is an extension [VK_EXT_device_fault](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/tree/main/proposals/VK_EXT_device_fault.adoc), there are no implementations yet. Both 
NVidia and AMD offer a breadcrumbs API - in the form of [VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap53.html#VK_NV_device_diagnostic_checkpoints) and [VK_AMD_buffer_marker](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap53.html#VK_AMD_buffer_marker) - essentially writing some bits by all suspect work until the device hangs - whereupon the last breadcrumb written points towards the culprit (hopefully).

As we see, the Graphics debugging is lagging behind Compute and certainly behind CPU debugging.

# CPU debugging 101
Program debugging under Linux uses the [ptrace](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html) syscall. Using this we can either signal that our process should be traced or we can attach to the program to be traced (called the *inferior*). The signals generated by the inferior are caught by the debugger. The debugger waits for a signal to happen,
then accesses the state of the inferior (reading / writing memory), then resumes it. Breakpoints are placed by rewriting the instruction to `int 3` - a single byte instruction 
that will cause the process to generate a `SIGTRAP` signal. It is also possible to set data breakpoints - these trigger when a piece memory is written. This is provided by the hardware,
x86 has a set of registers where you can set the addresses you are interested in.

The most well-known debugger under Linux, GDB, is a flexible software, it has a number of targets, which contain the knowledge on how to translate debugging actions (setting a breakpoint, reading the stackframe...) are implemented on the specific architecture. For a much more lengthy and detailed description see [Howto: Porting the GNU Debugger
](https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean3/embecosm-howto-gdb-porting-ean3-issue-2.html).

[rocgdb](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCgdb) is AMD's ROCm based gdb + custom target that can debug compute programs, which is not too far from what we would like, but it interacts with [amdkfd](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd), which is a separate KMD[^KMD] from [amdgpu](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu), that graphics applications use. 

But perhaps we can be inspired by what it does to the GPU? To get there, first a very short primer on how shaders are executed on AMD hardware.

# GCN/RDNA shader execution 101

On GCN/RDNA the fundamental unit of execution is a wavefront, or wave. A wave executes SIMD-like instructions (compiled from your SIMT GLSL or later SIMT SPIR-V for example).
A wave has its own set of general purpose registers (GPRs), some which are scalar (SGPRs) - 1 value per wave, and some that are vector (VGPRs) - as many values as the width of the SIMD.
Newer AMD hardware can execute shaders in `wave32` or `wave64` mode, which defines the width. Control flow is achieved via an explicit mask (`exec`) and scalar branching (`s_branch`, `s_cbranch_*`)[^PCWR].

```nasm
; scalar load of 2 dwords from the address in s[0:1] + offset of 0x10 to s[4:5]
s_load_dwordx2  s[4:5], s[0:1], 0x10
; logical left shift of each element of v0 by 2, stored into v0
v_lshlrev_b32  v0, 2, v0
; wait for all outstanding scalar loads
s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0)
; add all the elements of v1 and v0 and store the result in v1
v_add_nc_u32  v1, v0, v1
; broadcast s3 into all elements of v2
v_mov_b32     v2, s3
; change the exec mask into 0x10, turning off all lanes except the 16th
s_mov_b64     exec, 0x10
; read the value in v1 that corresponds to the first active lane (16th), and store it into s3
v_readfirstlane_b32 s3, v1
; store the value of v1 through a buffer resource in s[4:7] with an offset of 24, with global coherence (L1 cache control)
buffer_store_dword v1, off, s[4:7], null offset:24 glc
```

Each wave also maintains some scalar registers that determine additional miscellaneous state - condition codes, statuses and other flags.

Each wave executes on a SIMD unit, which in turn belongs to a WGP[^WGP] and/or CU[^CU], which belongs to a Shader Array (SA or SH), which belongs to a Shader Engine (SE).
In this way all waves on the device can be identified with this address (`se.sa.wgp.simd.wave_id`).

Graphics shaders have some special hardware bits as well - vertex and pixel shaders need to perform an "export", which passes data to the next pipeline stage.

# How would the shader debugger work?

According to the ISA manual[^RDNA2][^RDNA3], waves can have a trap handler - a small piece of shader program that can be run when the following happens:

- the trapping instruction (`s_trap #`) is encountered
- the shader encounters an unmasked exception - for example a floating point exception, or a memory violation
- the host tells the shader execution hardware that the currently running waves should enter the trap handler (host initiated trap)
- the wave is running in single stepping mode (`MODE.DEBUG_EN=1` or `MODE.TRAP_AFTER_INST=1`) and has run an instruction
- the wave is configured to enter the trap handler at the beginning or end of the wave (RDNA 3, [^RDNA3])

The trap handler can only be entered if a trap handler has been installed and enabled - this is shown by the wave's `STATUS.TRAP_EN` register. 
If `STATUS.TRAP_EN` is 0, then all of the above are treated as `NOP`s - except for certain exceptions, like memory violation, which kills the wave.

Once the trap handler is entered, the wave gets elevated privileges (`STATUS.PRIV=1`) and gets to tamper with its own state more freely - a number of the `STATUS`
register values become directly writable like `STATUS.SCC`. Additionally the wave gets 16 temporary trap scalar registers (`ttmp0`-`ttmp15`), which can be written
while the wave has elevated privilages (but this requires that we tell the hardware of this before the wave launches, since it needs to allocate these additional registers to the wave[^rdnattmp]).

Armed with this knowledge, the battle plan is formed for making the debugger.

# The Plan

1. compile a trap handler
2. upload the trap handler shader & install it and ask the wave to be launched with `ttmp`s reserved
3. invoke one of the above methods of triggering the trap handler for a specific wave
4. use a piece of memory to communicate to the host (👋 hey host! i am in the trap handler now)
    - if we want to breakpoint on an instruction instead of just the wave, we can now enable single stepping
5. park the wave somehow until the host tells us to continue
6. repeat entering the trap handler and waiting for the host as required

But there is a big issue - this Plan involves us hanging the GPU. Parking a wave means that the currently inflight work will not finish until the host is done - and this is a hang even though we will eventually resume the work.
Since we can't interact meaningfully with a hung desktop, we need to run the debugger on a desktop that has not hung. Of our options, we will look at doing remote access to the computer where our graphics is to be debugged.
This will also be helpful in case we *accidentally* hang the GPU for real!

In the next post we will look at setting up a development environment and then onto implementation.
