# Intro

We have a development environment going now, so it is time to execute on our first piece of the puzzle - installing the trap handler.

1. ~~compile a trap handler~~ ✔️
2. **upload the trap handler shader & install it and ask the wave to be launched with `ttmp`s reserved**
3. **invoke one of the methods of triggering the trap handler for a specific wave**
4. use a piece of memory to communicate to the host (👋 hey host! i am in the trap handler now)
    - if we want to breakpoint on an instruction instead of just the wave, we can now enable single stepping
5. park the wave somehow until the host tells us to continue
6. repeat entering the trap handler and waiting for the host as required

# Uploading and installing the trap handler
To check if we managed to successfully install a trap handler, we can use [umr](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/tomstdenis/umr/-/tree/main). We dump the waves executing on the GPU and check `STATUS.TRAP_EN`. If that flag is `1`, then the trap handler is ready to go. Below is a part of the output we can get from `umr` by running `sudo umr -O bits,halt_waves -go 0 -wa gfx_0.0.0`: all wave state is displayed for each active wave. Furthermore, we get a disassembly of the code that the wave is currently executing, where `*` marks the current instruction to be executed.

To install the trap handler, we now need to enlist the help of the driver, since we want to alter the state of the debugee. So let's search for the most appropriate place to do this in `radv`...

... and its already [there](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/6384)! 

A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. This MR seems to do what we want: 
uses `aco` to compile a trap handler shader, uploads it, installs it and sets all the appropriate state for the hardware for it to be used. Excellent, we only need to set `RADV_TRAP_HANDLER` as an env variable to have trap handlers 
in `radv`.

Except the relevant code for trap handlers in `radv` is gated behind asserts requiring `gfx8` or lower and I want to run this on `gfx10.3`.
Let's see what happens if we just remove the asserts and let it run anyway - welcome baby's first mesa [MR](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20354) for fixing an uninitialized struct on the trap handler path.

I suppose that is a testament to the number of users for this so far. But no matter, with that fixed we try to enable the trap handler - and nothing happens. This is too anticlimactic, so let's do some more research. It turns out Samuel Pitoiset has done more work on this: [a second MR for gfx8+](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/6488). And this MR comes with a related
*stalled* [kernel patch](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200824114916.11808-1-samuel.pitoiset@gmail.com/T/#m1484b62bec2284cefa007a731d81c8ed9d53457a) as well.

It appears that the requirement for installing the trap handler is setting the `TBA`[^TBA] and `TMA`[^TMA] registers. On `gfx8` and below, setting these are nonprivileged operations and can be done via packets
(what the first mesa MR enables). However from `gfx9` and above, setting `TBA` and `TMA` is a privileged operation and only the kernel can do it. And currently it doesn't.

I wavered a bit at this point. Could it be that this functionality doesn't work on `gfx10`? Even if it does, is my 10 day Linux driver stack experience enough to patch the kernel to enable this?
Fortunately, I realized that the kernel can be sidestepped here - enter `umr`.

# Cutting out the middlemen

So far we have used `umr` to look at the state of the GPU. `umr` stands for "User Mode Register Debugger", so how can it interface with the GPU if it is user mode? In fact, how can any program talk to the GPU?

Generally, applications talk to a user-mode driver (UMD), like `radv`, via an API, such as Vulkan, OpenCL, you name it. The UMD does some work transforming this incoming data into a format that the kernel mode driver (KMD)
understands and talks to the KMD via `ioctl`s. An `ioctl` is comparable to a `syscall`: an entrypoint into the kernel. You prepare a command and some data, invoke the `ioctl`, the kernel driver takes over and performs what you requested.

Then the KMD needs to talk to the GPU. The easiest way to do this is by toggling certain GPU registers, and perform writes to the VRAM. But this does not scale well, you'd need the KMD to continuously keep up with commands executed.
Instead the KMD writes commands for what the GPU should do, which the GPU can execute on its own. The unit consuming these instruction is called the Command Processor (CP). The GPU has multiple independent 
command processors, which map to queues in Vulkan or rings[^ring] in `amdgpu`.

> In fact when we previously dumped the waves with `umr`, we specified the graphics ring (`gfx_0.0.0`).

But it is still possible to write registers from the host (done via memory mapped I/O (MMIO) and others), which is usually done by the KMD for maintenance tasks, such as starting or resetting the GPU, and other housekeeping.

Fortunately, `amdgpu` bestows the userspace with powers of the kernel. It is possible (with elevated privileges) to access KMD and GPU functions - this is what `umr` is doing. The KMD exposes a `debugfs` 
interface (essentially file descriptors located in `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/<device_id>/`) that will call into the KMD when read or written.

What this means for us is that if the trap handler installation requires setting some registers, we can probably do it ourselves instead of having to get a new kernel!

## Banked registers

An important aspect of setting registers is banking. The GPU can have many of a certain type of register, because the GPU has many instances of the same hardware block. To access the register of a certain hardware block,
we need to first select hardware block (or *bank*). There are two banking mechanisms important for us: `GRBM`, which selects by `SE`, `SA` and `INSTANCE` 
(which is a combination of WGP and SIMD indices), and `SRBM` which selects based on `ME`, `PIPE`, `QUEUE` and `VMID`[^VMID]. 
When we perform a banked register read or write, `umr` tells the KMD to first set the `GRBM` or `SRBM`, thereby activating the 
bank we want, then performs the access on the register instance. For writes it is also possible to have them broadcast into multiple banks. The reason we need a bit of dance is because the `GRBM` and `SRBM` selector registers are global -
another process (or the kernel itself) could change them simultaneously, and then our write will go to the wrong bank. For this reason we need the KMD arbitrating (with a lock) to facilitate race-free MMIO.

## Incantations of trap enablement

We have code in `radv` that sets up a shader and a buffer, so we don't need to write that code ourselves for now. For simplicity, we can just write these virtual addresses to a file, then have the debugger program enable them.
In the debugger, we use MMIO to write the relevant registers (`TBA_LO`, `TBA_HI`, `TMA_LO`, `TMA_HI`). The addresses need to be aligned, so we drop the low `8` bits. 
There is also a bit in `TBA_HI` that must be set for `gfx10+` for the trap to be enabled. If we want to disable the trap, we can just clear this bit.


```cpp
#define SQ_SHADER_TBA_HI__TRAP_ENABLE (1 << 0x1f)

int enable_debugging(uint64_t tba_va, uint64_t tma_va){
    umr_reg* reg_tba_lo = umr_find_reg_data(asic, "mmSQ_SHADER_TBA_LO");
    if(!reg_tba_lo){
        asic->err_msg("[BUG]: Cannot find TBA_LO register\n");
        return -1;
    }

    umr_reg* reg_tba_hi = umr_find_reg_data(asic, "mmSQ_SHADER_TBA_HI");
    if(!reg_tba_hi){
        asic->err_msg("[BUG]: Cannot find TBA_HI register\n");
        return -1;
    }

    umr_reg* reg_tma_lo = umr_find_reg_data(asic, "mmSQ_SHADER_TMA_LO");
    if(!reg_tma_lo){
        asic->err_msg("[BUG]: Cannot find TMA_LO register\n");
        return -1;
    }

    umr_reg* reg_tma_hi = umr_find_reg_data(asic, "mmSQ_SHADER_TMA_HI");
    if(!reg_tma_hi){
        asic->err_msg("[BUG]: Cannot find TMA_HI register\n");
        return -1;
    }
  
    asic->options.use_bank = 2;
    asic->options.bank.srbm.me = 0;
    asic->options.bank.srbm.pipe = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < 15; i++){
        asic->options.bank.srbm.vmid = i;
        
        // drop low 8 bits, and take low 32 bits of the result
        asic->reg_funcs.write_reg(asic, reg_tba_lo->addr * 4, tba_va >> 8, reg_tba_lo->type);
        // drop low 8 bits, and take high 32 bits of the result (not all used)
        asic->reg_funcs.write_reg(asic, reg_tba_hi->addr * 4, (tba_va >> 40) | SQ_SHADER_TBA_HI__TRAP_ENABLE, reg_tba_hi->type);
        // drop low 8 bits, and take low 32 bits of the result
        asic->reg_funcs.write_reg(asic, reg_tma_lo->addr * 4, tma_va >> 8, reg_tma_lo->type);
        // drop low 8 bits, and take high 32 bits of the result (not all used)
        asic->reg_funcs.write_reg(asic, reg_tma_hi->addr * 4, (tma_va >> 40), reg_tma_hi->type);
    }

    return 0;
}

int disable_debugging(){
    umr_reg *reg = umr_find_reg_data(asic, "mmSQ_SHADER_TBA_HI");
    if(!reg){
        asic->err_msg("[BUG]: Cannot find TBA_HI register\n");
        return -1;
    }

    asic->options.use_bank = 2;
    asic->options.bank.srbm.me = 0;
    asic->options.bank.srbm.pipe = 0;

    for(int i = 1; i < 15; i++){
        asic->options.bank.srbm.vmid = i;
        
        unsigned v = asic->reg_funcs.read_reg(asic, reg->addr * 4, reg->type);
        asic->reg_funcs.write_reg(asic, reg->addr * 4, v & ~(1 << SQ_SHADER_TBA_HI__TRAP_EN__SHIFT), reg->type);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For this initial implementation we don't bother to be selective and just loop over all of the VMIDs and set the trap handler registers (`VMID0` is special, so that we skip).

And if we now query the waves with `umr`:

![umr showing trap_en set](/assets/radbg/trap_en.png){: h="300" }
_Grepping for `trap_en` in the `umr` output shows us that the waves are now launching with the trap handler._

# Invoking the trap handler

Since `umr` is indicating our success, it is time to test actually invoking the trap handler. We will install very simple trap handler, that just calls `s_sleep` before returning.
We will see in the next part how to make proper trap handlers, but suffice to say that this following one just delays the wave before continuing.

```nasm
; depending on how many waves are running per frame, we might need more or less
; sleeping for the frame time to be significantly different.
; one s_sleep is limited to 127*64 cycles (the actual amount slept is not precise), 
; therefore we can add more s_sleeps to increase the time taken.
s_sleep 127
s_sleep 127
s_sleep 127
s_sleep 127

s_add_u32 ttmp0, ttmp0, 4
s_addc_u32 ttmp1, ttmp1, 0
s_and_b32 ttmp1, ttmp1, 0xffff
s_rfe_b64 [ttmp0, ttmp1]
```
{: file="sleepy-trap-handler.isa" }

To put this shader on the GPU, we change out the trap handler shader to our binary:

```cpp
struct radv_trap_handler_shader *
radv_create_trap_handler_shader(struct radv_device *device)
{
   struct radv_trap_handler_shader *trap;

   trap = malloc(sizeof(struct radv_trap_handler_shader));
   if (!trap)
      return NULL;

   FILE *f = fopen("/home/deck/radbg-poc/asmc.hex", "rb");
   fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);
   long asmc_len = ftell(f);
   fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);

   char *asmc = malloc(asmc_len);
   fread(asmc, asmc_len, 1, f);
   fclose(f);

   trap->alloc = radv_alloc_shader_memory(device, asmc_len, NULL);

   trap->bo = trap->alloc->arena->bo;
   char *dest_ptr = trap->alloc->arena->ptr + trap->alloc->offset;
   
   memcpy(dest_ptr, asmc, asmc_len);

   return trap;
}
```
{: file="src/amd/vulkan/radv_shader.c" }

Although there are a number of ways to invoke the trap handler, the easiest is to have the `s_trap #` instruction. The immediate value is the trap ID, which must be non-zero. We can modify the instruction selection in `aco` to have `s_trap 2` emitted into all shaders:

```diff
void
select_program(Program* program, unsigned shader_count, struct nir_shader* const* shaders,
               ac_shader_config* config, const struct aco_compiler_options* options,
               const struct aco_shader_info* info,
               const struct radv_shader_args* args)
{
   isel_context ctx = setup_isel_context(program, shader_count, shaders, config, options, info, args, false);
   if_context ic_merged_wave_info;
   bool ngg_gs = ctx.stage.hw == HWStage::NGG && ctx.stage.has(SWStage::GS);

   for (unsigned i = 0; i < shader_count; i++) {
      nir_shader* nir = shaders[i];
      init_context(&ctx, nir);

      setup_fp_mode(&ctx, nir);

      if (!i) {
         /* needs to be after init_context() for FS */
         Pseudo_instruction* startpgm = add_startpgm(&ctx);
         append_logical_start(ctx.block);

         if (unlikely(ctx.options->has_ls_vgpr_init_bug && ctx.stage == vertex_tess_control_hs))
            fix_ls_vgpr_init_bug(&ctx, startpgm);

         split_arguments(&ctx, startpgm);

         if (!info->vs.has_prolog &&
             (program->stage.has(SWStage::VS) || program->stage.has(SWStage::TES))) {
            Builder(ctx.program, ctx.block).sopp(aco_opcode::s_setprio, -1u, 0x3u);
         }
      }
+     {
+        Builder bld(ctx.program, ctx.block);
+        bld.sopp(aco_opcode::s_trap, -1u, 2);
+     }
```

After running with the app with a rebuilt `radv`, success - we can toggle an FPS drop in our test app! We can tick off another two steps from the plan.

In the next part we will make the trap handler talk to the host, and make the host talk to the trap handler, to give control over shader execution to the debugger.

# Footnotes and glossary

[^TBA]: Trap Base Address - address of the trap handler shader
[^TMA]: Trap Memory Address - an address available to the trap handler shader, for temporary storage or other use
[^ring]: the host writes to ringbuffers for the various command processors to consume
[^VMID]: multiple virtual memory tables can be active at the same time on the GPU to achieve process isolation. The KMD assigns VMIDs dynamically to processes to identify which tables they use. There can be at most 15 concurrent processes executing (VMIDs 1-15). `VMID0` is reserved for physical addresses.
